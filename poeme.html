            Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
            His house is in the village though;<br>
            He will not see me stopping here<br>
            To watch his woods fill up with snow. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My little horse must think it queer<br>
            To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
            Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
            The darkest evening of the year.

            He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
            To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
            The only other sound's the sweep<br>
            Of easy wind and downy flake.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
            But I have promises to keep,<br>
            And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
            And miles to go before I sleep.
